# TYPO3 File Structure
https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/11.5/en-us/ApiOverview/DirectoryStructure/Index.html 
	
## config/ 
TYPO3 configuration directory. This directory contains installation-wide configuration.

- config/sites/ : The folder config/sites contains subfolders for each site configuration.

## local_packages/ 
Each web site which is run on TYPO3 should have a sitepackage, an extension with a special purpose containing all templates, styles, images, etc. needed for the theme. It is usually stored locally and then symlinked into the vendor/ folder. Many projects also need custom extensions that can be stored here.

## public/ 
We assume here that your web root points to a folder called public in a Composer-based installation as is commonly done. Otherwise, replace public with the path to your web root.

- public/fileadmin/ : This is a directory in which editors store files. Typically images, PDFs or video files appear in this directory and/or its subdirectories. This is only the default editor's file storage. This directory is handled via the FAL API internally, there may be further storage locations configured outside of fileadmin/, even pointing to different servers or using 3rd party digital asset management systems.

- public/typo3/ : TYPO3 Backend directory. This directory contains most of the files coming with the TYPO3 Core. The files are arranged logically in the different system extensions in the sysext/ directory, according to the application area of the particular file. For example, the "frontend" extension amongst other things contains the "TypoScript library", the code for generating the Frontend website. In each system extension the PHP files are located in the folder Classes/.

- public/typo3conf/ : Amongst others, this directory contains the files LocalConfiguration.php and AdditionalConfiguration.php.
  - public/typo3conf/ext/ : Directory for third-party and custom TYPO3 extensions. Each subdirectory contains one extension.

- public/typo3temp/ : Directory for temporary files. It contains subdirectories for temporary files of extensions and TYPO3 components.
  - public/typo3temp/assets/ : Directory for temporary files that should be public available (e.g. generated images).

## var/ 
var/ is a directory for temporary files that contains private files (e.g. cache and logs files) and should not be publicly available.

- var/cache/ : This directory contains internal files needed for the cache.

- var/labels/ : The directory var/labels/ is for extension localizations. It contains all downloaded translation files. This path can be retrieved from the Environment API.

- var/log/ : This directory contains log files like the TYPO3 log, the deprecations log and logs generated by extensions.

## vendor/ 
In this directory, which lies outside of the webroot, third-party dependencies that are not TYPO3 extensions are installed.
